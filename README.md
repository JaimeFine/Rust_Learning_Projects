# Rust Learning Projects: Experiments and Extensions

This repository contains a collection of Rust-based projects created and modified as part of my personal learning journey. Some are inspired by examples from The Rust Programming Language (licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0), while others are adapted from Rust Cookbook (dual-licensed under MIT or Apache License 2.0).

> All modifications, extensions, and documentation are made with the intention of deepening my understanding of Rust and GitHub workflows. If you notice any licensing issues or have suggestions for improvement, I welcome your feedback.
